# CARLA-Semantic-Segmentation-YOLOv8
Utilizing the CARLA Simulation to collect datasets and utilizing the YOLOv8 computer vision model to semantic segment each pixel in the CARLA scene.

Goal: Utilizing various vision models to semantic segment CARLA Simulaton images and compare the results against each other in order to know what kind of models can be used for specific industry applications/specific problems.
